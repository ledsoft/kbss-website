The Open mic session starts on Friday 29 November 2024 at 10:30 via [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Miroslav Blaško](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#miroslav-blaško), who will talk about the development of Docker-based services at KBSS.

##### The abstract

The aim of this talk is to introduce alternative ways how to develop Docker services that are orchestrated using Docker Compose. When dealing with a large number of interdependent services, it is usually complicated to develop individual services. Instead of running all the dependent services from IDE separately, we elaborate on the idea of reusing the orchestration from the Docker Compose setup. Multiple alternatives to this use case will be shown and compared. Moreover, we will shortly address issues related to debugging services in the Docker Compose setup, a critical aspect of the development workflow. This talk is designed to provide practical insights and solutions.
