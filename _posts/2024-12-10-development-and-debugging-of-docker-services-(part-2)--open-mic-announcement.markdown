The Open mic session starts on Friday 13 December 2024 at 10:30 via [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Miroslav Blaško](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#miroslav-blaško), who will talk about the development of Docker-based services at KBSS.

##### The abstract

The aim of this talk is to introduce alternative ways how to develop Docker services that are orchestrated using Docker Compose. When dealing with a large number of interdependent services, it is usually complicated to develop individual services. Instead of running all the dependent services from IDE separately, we elaborate on the idea of reusing the orchestration from the Docker Compose setup. Two major alternative solutions to address this use case were introduced in [previous talk](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/development-and-debugging-of-docker-services-(part-1)-open-mic-summary) with the first one explained in detail and demonstrated using an example Docker Compose setup. The goal of this second talk in the two-part series is to explain the second solution in detail and compare it to the first one.
